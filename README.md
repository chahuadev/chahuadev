### 👋 Hi there, I'm Saharath C. (@chahuadev)

I'm a software developer from Thailand with a passion for transforming complex problems into simple, elegant, and secure software solutions.

At the heart of my work is the **Chahuadev Framework**, a desktop application framework I built from the ground up.

---

### 🚀 My Flagship Project: Chahuadev Framework

The **Chahuadev Framework** is a powerful plugin management system designed for desktop applications, with a core focus on security and ease of use. It's the embodiment of my "From Chaos to Code" philosophy.

* 🛡️ **Fort-Knox Level Security:** Features advanced security systems like anti-debugging, IPC command sanitization, and runtime integrity checks to protect the application and its users.
* 🔌 **Smart Plugin System:** Easily manage, scan, and integrate plugins into your projects.
* 🔑 **Built-in License Management:** Comes with a ready-to-use system for creating and validating software licenses.
* 🛠️ **Developer-Focused Tools:** Includes an integrated debugger and powerful command-line tools to streamline the development process.
