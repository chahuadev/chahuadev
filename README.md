## About Me

I'm a **38-year-old European cuisine chef** who transforms ingredients into culinary art during the day, and code into software solutions during the night. After my kitchen shifts (ending at 24:00), I dedicate **5 hours daily** (07:00-14:00) to pursuing my passion for software development.

```javascript
const chahua = {
  mainCareer: "European Chef Kon Krua ",
  passion: "Software Development",
  age: 38,
  codingSchedule: "06:00 - 14:00 (UTC+7)",
  philosophy: "Precision in cooking, precision in code",
  languages: ["Thai ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­", "English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§"],
  dreamJob: "Full-stack Developer | DevOps Engineer"
};
```

## My Journey

From the **heat of professional kitchens** to the **logic of code**, I bring the same dedication and creativity to both worlds:

-  **Day Job**: Crafting European dishes with precision and passion
-  **Night Passion**: Building developer tools and web applications
-  **Self-Taught**: Learning programming through dedication and 9 hours of daily practice
-  **Goal**: Transition from culinary arts to full-time software engineering
